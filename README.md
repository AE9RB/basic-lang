# 64K BASIC

The BASIC programming language as it was on 8-bit CPUs.

```
64K BASIC
READY.
10 FOR I=1 TO 2
20 PRINT "Hello World"
30 NEXT I
RUN
Hello World
Hello World
READY.
```

Future versions of BASIC used more structure and less
lines numbers and GOTOs. This project is a historical
preservation of BASIC just before then. A time when most
people were learning about computers by typing in BASIC
programs published in books and magazines.

The first computer book to sell one million copies was a
collection of BASIC Computer Games. It was followed up with
More BASIC Computer Games. You can run all those and more
with this dialect of BASIC.
