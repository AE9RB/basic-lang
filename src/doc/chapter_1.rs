# General Information

Although the first version of BASIC supported punched cards,
it was designed primarily as an interactive language.
Since they had to support teletypes, which couldn't erase characters,
the interface was terrible by today's standards. Things got a lot
better when CRTs came along and then again when terminals got more
sophisticated.

64K BASIC is readline-like. Commands are stored in history which you can
access with up/down arrows and CTRL-R.
Editing a line is as simple as typing its number and pressing TAB for completion.
Your modern terminal probably has many megabytes of output history.
It still feels like classic BASIC, only without the frustration of
an obsolete and unfamiliar interface.
